# Visualising Global Development

In this assignment, you will work in `rmarkdown` and learn to create moving visualisations of global development just like Hans Rosling did but with R and `gganimate` package, and gapminder dataset. Make sure to read the R messages regarding this package and its other associates. 

Have fun making it move!
